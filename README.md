# VanBuilder
Repository of 3D SketchFab models for designing camper conversions

Models are built using the 2017 version of Sketchup Make. They are shared for others to add to and reuse to help design and visualise their personal campervan conversion projects and not to be sold or used in any professional capacity.

Disclaimer: All measurements are based on approximates and it is the user's responsibility to check the dimensions of their own van and the products they purchase for their conversion.
